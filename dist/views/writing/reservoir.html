<h3>Reservoir</h3>
<p>At six in the morning I drove through a back road around half of Lake Hefner. A man-made reservoir at the corner of Oklahoma City, yet the closest nature accessible at six in the morning on a school day of the senior year of high school. The back road is always quiet, few headlights but the glow of lamps overhead interrupting only around a bend at the firehouse and the six lane road only two hundred meters away; but the road bends back toward the docks, through the golf course, away from middle class neighborhoods, and up a hill along the lake. Here I'd park every few mornings, as Walt Whitman among the leaves of grass, along the side of a man-made reservoir at the center of a man-made urban space to escape; and here I've parked four years of memories in the solitude of nature's anonymity.</p>
<p>Every trip around the lake, be it alone or with close friends in tow, begins at a four-way stop south of a lakeside park. From the east, one road stretches through a 50s neighborhood, over a ceaseless highway, and spans west along the southern branches of the lake, four hundred meters behind woods, yet peeking through in the winter, running under a discrete bridge when satiated. From the south, a major road turned two-lane street intersects and runs north into the park. When in a drought, there is little special about the flat, grassy space peppered with picnic tables and the odd, lone tree; but when the water flows up to this concrete peninsula, the soul reflects and refracts upon the surface of teal ripples and eddies in the jagged rocks and concrete blocks on the shore.</p>
<p> In summers past I arrived with two or three others and felt the lake's presence whirl through every sense in a pool of synesthesia. Once we sat at the edge of the dungy park&mdash;children in the distance feeding geese with slices of white bread from the pantry&mdash;both feet placed among the jutting rocks with algae and the odd plastic bag or bottle afoot. A sharp inhale  painted a flow of past Melvillian nautical adventures&mdash;the recurring fascination with cattails from a fishing expedition long ago and the sight of fishing line glistening in the last summer's haze before the onset of a thunderstorm. A slow exhale ebbed in the fading memories, but reveled in the growing presence of cigarette butts and plastic bottles and the suffocating catfish at the end of my childhood line. Inhale, exhale; ebb and flow. Continuously the reservoir of elation and depression eddied and forced me into the solitude of abstract experience. I looked away from the quietly undulating surface, beyond the cityscape across the shore, and to the slow moving clouds and deep blue skies above&mdash;as blue as the eyes of a sudden moment of eye contact when the heart races, all nature drowns out the noise of blabbering adolescents, and the lips part in the sudden movement of inhalation, exhalation, ebb and flow.</p>
<p>Thoughts of a more distant past in this same park emerges from the depths of this surreal experience with the only heavens we know&mdash;heavens that pass above while loafing in the grass like Whitman. Every blade of grass under the blanket cradles the head, the back, the legs, the feet of four tired high schoolers while staring straight up into our own frames of existence. Few cirrus, but cumulus sails as Columbus across the sea and overtakes each lens in due time before colonizing other children's wondrous pleas to Mother Nature above. Lazing on a summer's day is a moment to relax the mind, to wade through heartbreak and euphoria and pure fantasy at once, yet drowning under the surface with crags that snag, waiting for something&mdash;someone&mdash;to pull me out of the tidal wave.</p>
<p>Beyond this intersection, this four-way stop between the city and solitude, the road cuts through sparse woods, the firehouse, the golf course, and a right turn brings me up a hill along the west shore of the lake. A few minutes down this road beside diverging neighborhoods to the left and a growing horizon to the right brings me no more than twenty feet from the undulating surface of the lake. Nothing but a three foot wall and a steep slope of more litter and more natural and concrete figures lines the right side of this road. To the left, large homes are more than two hundred feet away, down a much steeper, grassy hill, where they disturb no one but themselves. For mornings parked along the periphery, I rolled down the passenger-side window of my high school, three-seat truck, set my phone's alarm, and simply slept. I let the waves&mdash;the interminable waves, as faint as they were&mdash;and the rare steps of a morning runner or the clicks of a morning cyclist overtake reality. I had Virginia Woolf's The Waves tucked in the driver-side door's pocket and I occasionally read the opening: &ldquo;The sun had not yet risen. The sea was indistinguishable from the sky, except that the sea was slightly creased as if a cloth had wrinkles in it.&rdquo; Two sentences alone were enough to create a paradise and I would live in it, plunge into it, make it reality for the fifteen minutes of unadulterated nature&mdash;man-made nature shared, nonetheless, by the gulls, the cyclist, the runner, the winding asphalt around the rim, all sharing in the fifteen minutes of a still, starry night, yet the inevitable morning encroached on our space, and for those mornings at 6:15, after the alarm, the ignition, the last trip before reaching the highway&mdash;one last exhale.</p>
<p>This road that stretches from west to north shore became the center of meditation, both alone and occasionally with a partner in this oft neglected crime. Beautiful moments shared with souls lost amongst the noise of modernity along a man-made reservoir. Once was a German foreign exchange student in the fall just after a thunderstorm. Only the embers of burnt orange in a mass of receding shelves. Our conversation is lost to the humid, shadowy evening in the sea of instantaneous experience along the creases of the darkening lake; yet the most vivid of all experiences along this periphery is an inhospitably cold night the following year&mdash;28 February 2009. Two wholly lost souls sharing a car's fading heat, yet both opening the moon roof to peer into the most beautiful masterpiece of all nature&mdash;both man and mother. No Michelangelo or Da Vinci or Pollock rivals the infinite expanse of the sky above on a cold winter's night. Below freezing, yet the warmest the soul feels amidst the chaos and anonymity of nature's entropy and sheer chance&mdash;to place us both in this time and place as we hurtle around a sun and count our days with arbitrary new years and the pressures of the world collapse the hull of our experience. The moon is lost in the creases of the fabric of the cosmos, yet the dark void is a reservoir for all reality in which the stars, the distant planets, the gas giants, the moon, the earth share in the ebb and flow and constant, yet chaotic change.</p>
<p>Upon every return to this reservoir, a new well of emotion emerges from the solitary ruminations of fishers feeding lines through poles and propping their day's acquaintance against the stone wall that protects against expectation. It is not the catch, but the experience. Melville understood that and these two or three fishermen huddled around the erected monuments to lazy days care only about the experience of themselves in the open air&mdash;away from the television, the pruned shrubs, the fertilized lawns. What snags at the other end of the line is inconsequential to the catch of the day. For the runner weaving between passing and stationary cars, the sound of their breath against the pounding of their feet on loose pebbles conducts a symphony that cools the spirit on a hot summer's day. The suit and tie, the dress and hose give way to billowy, oft revealing attire that all those aching, but euphoric souls don in their liberating jog through the slowing time that passes around them. The gulls seem to beat their wings to the rhythm of nature, the clock of which sets its time to the glaciers that now hasten their retreat as man seeks efficiency and productivity. But even the passing cars ending their lunch break seem to slow themselves to watch the waves before returning to modernity. Even the lonely boy sitting on the jagged wall that separates man from enlightenment watches the waves instead of the bar tab on a supposedly important milestone in his sober life. For once I let my music overtake the waves as I watched the orange glisters blanketing the rippling surface of reflection. The pounding of the bass line, the urgency of a man's voice crying out for social change seemed to carry the same rhythm as the other voices surrounding me that day. The middle-aged friends cycling behind the young, fit yuppies&mdash;some laughing, some conversing, some as silent as the eye of some great storm brewing in introspection&mdash;all open themselves to the same sounds rearranged in new words, new terms of endearment, new lyrics, and new calls from nature. Around the lake every reconfiguration of nature's audible ripples through space permeates through every corner, waiting for a receptive ear to enter the deep crevices of its music. John Cage heard music in the ceaseless traffic of a New York afternoon; I heard music in the ceaseless panoply of man in intimate contact with nature. And when I let the music fade and reopened my experience to the sounds of the lake, the music never stopped. The lake's waves in one ear complemented the man-made waves in the other. Chaos and order met as one between one channel of audible experience and another, forming a harmony oft forgotten to the ears closed to new ways of feeling the beat of the universe's heart.</p>
<p>In that space between man and nature I witnessed a new sight to my inexperienced eyes. The sun's reflection in the morphing mirror played its own fife and drum against the Earth's undulating rhythm through space. The orange and blue waves were the static I remember from the days of analog television when bunny ears and frustrated turns of a useless dial occupied every living room. Staring into that monochrome chaos was a harrowing experience, yet one that I could not look away from. The confetti of an unused channel seemed to maintain a steady pace despite the nonsense it spoke to bewildered consumers looking for escape. The sun, though, seemed to hasten its march across the surface of the lake toward me. The faint ripples multiplied as I watched more intently, each shift from the lake's natural surface to the blinding orange glow was a strobe light, then four, then sixteen as the light danced from fold to fold. The sun's pas de deux with the lake imitated the red tide creeping across the surface before breaking in the eddies of the shoreline. I peered at the horizon, the sky, the passing cars, runners, and cyclists from left to right before returning again to encore after encore of nature's chaotic ballet. The images of a vast orange ball of molten matter and a drop of water steaming as it hits the stove top give way to the sight of the massive center of our existence and the collective body of all lakes, rivers, oceans, and man-made reservoirs swirling around one another in a yin yang whose close encounters are the mad scene of Lucia di Lammermoor, but from afar are Erik Satie's Gymnop&eacute;dies. Chaos in order; order in chaos&mdash;two lost boys in a cold car exchanging sob stories or two fishermen remembering what it was like to live and loaf in nature.</p>
<p>I don't know why the image I always associate with my sanity is an infinitely deep lake. A lake I will never stop drowning in. I can see the shore. I can see the hordes of faces, nay, just one face. A boy, a man, an indescribable figure of my imagination. His hand reaches out, but as I find hope, as I give into false expectations, the hand withdraws and I am again falling. Falling. Drowning. Losing myself in the loneliness of the moment. Perhaps that is the issue&mdash;we expect something from nature when nature has nothing to give us. Mother Nature cares only about the equilibrations necessary to balance the forces of destruction and creation&mdash;but destruction and creation that are the collapsing probability wave. A supernova and two boys gazing at the stars are one and the same to forces of nature we cannot control. It is hopeless and lonely when we attach meaning to that which inherits none. Perhaps we all drown in lakes of our own creation, wading under the surface, seeking Truth that exists only as the figures of our imagination that extend their hand into the surface, but disperse as quickly as a school of fish in sight of its predators. At the edge of the reservoir we all hope to be the beacons of change and all that is good about the human condition, but we all find ourselves simply modeling our lives off those before and with us&mdash;what else do we know? Even Da Vinci had someone to look up to. The loneliness in our souls need not be fulfilled as we peer into the surface. It's not loneliness&mdash;it's solitude.</p>
<p>Closing my eyes and feeling the smell of the lake, hearing the satin surface, and plunging deep into the furrows of all grandeur and horror evoke only Philip Glass and Allen Ginsberg performing Wichita Vortex Sutra:</p>
<p><pre>  I'm an old man now, and a lonesome man in Kansas
    but not afraid
      to speak my lonesomeness in a car,
      because not only my lonesomeness
        it's Ours, all over America,
            O tender fellows&mdash;
        &amp; spoken lonesomeness is Prophecy
        in the moon 100 years ago or in
                the middle of Kansas now.</pre></p>
<p>The constant, beautiful, yet harrowing movement becomes one and nothing as the lake becomes one with a dark sky, foggy morning, or as the eye moves from one shade of blue to another, yet interrupted by the highway that dares to wrap itself along the east side of this experience, contextualizing the brief moments of human nature in intimate contact with all of nature. Inhale as the dark skies offer dreams to the astronaut and poet alike and exhale at daybreak when the roads wail, the haze of modernity returns, and the window, the moon roof, the eyes of a daysleeper close and so-called life moves on again. But death is a bosom I will, and all will, share in due time. The reservoir of life depends upon the satiation of death and, indeed, from death new life&mdash;in the ebb and flow of our memories and existence&mdash;shall rise again.</p>
